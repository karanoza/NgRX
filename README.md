NgRx is a library for reactive state management in Angular applications, that provides a predictable state container and facilitates managing and tracking changes to your application's state using concepts like actions, reducers, effects, and selectors.
I have implemented the same in the project for the reference purpose you can clone the repo and just do npm install and ng serve.
